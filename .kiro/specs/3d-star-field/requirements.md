# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a 3D star field visualization that displays animated stars in three-dimensional space. The star field creates an immersive visual experience with stars that appear to move through space, providing depth perception and smooth animation. Users can interact with the star field through mouse controls and customize various visual parameters.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a 3D star field with animated stars, so that I can enjoy an immersive space-like visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a 3D star field with at least 1000 individual stars
2. WHEN stars are rendered THEN each star SHALL have a random position in 3D space within defined boundaries
3. WHEN the animation runs THEN stars SHALL move continuously toward the viewer creating a "flying through space" effect
4. WHEN a star reaches the viewer's position THEN the system SHALL reset the star to a distant position
5. WHEN stars move closer to the viewer THEN they SHALL appear larger and brighter

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the star field with my mouse, so that I can interact with and explore the 3D space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user moves the mouse THEN the star field SHALL rotate smoothly in response to mouse movement
2. WHEN the user moves the mouse horizontally THEN the star field SHALL rotate around the Y-axis
3. WHEN the user moves the mouse vertically THEN the star field SHALL rotate around the X-axis
4. WHEN the mouse is stationary THEN the star field SHALL maintain its current rotation
5. WHEN the user moves the mouse quickly THEN the rotation SHALL be smooth without jerky movements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the star field to have realistic visual properties, so that it looks convincing and aesthetically pleasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stars are rendered THEN they SHALL have varying sizes to create depth perception
2. WHEN stars are distant THEN they SHALL appear smaller and dimmer
3. WHEN stars are close THEN they SHALL appear larger and brighter with a glowing effect
4. WHEN the star field is displayed THEN stars SHALL have a white or slightly blue-white color
5. WHEN stars move THEN they SHALL leave subtle trails to enhance the motion effect
6. WHEN the background is rendered THEN it SHALL be deep black to simulate space

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the star field to perform smoothly, so that users have a fluid experience without lag or stuttering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the animation runs THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 60 frames per second
2. WHEN rendering stars THEN the system SHALL use efficient WebGL or Canvas rendering techniques
3. WHEN the star count is high THEN the system SHALL optimize rendering to prevent performance degradation
4. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN the star field SHALL adapt smoothly to the new dimensions
5. WHEN running on lower-end devices THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce star count if needed to maintain performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the star field appearance, so that I can adjust it to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses controls THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust star count
2. WHEN the user changes star count THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time
3. WHEN the user accesses controls THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust animation speed
4. WHEN the user changes animation speed THEN stars SHALL move faster or slower accordingly
5. WHEN the user accesses controls THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust star colors
6. WHEN the user changes color settings THEN stars SHALL update their appearance immediately
